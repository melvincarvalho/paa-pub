# Kaiāulu Pa'a

Single-user [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) + [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) server that runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers.

Own your identity and data. Your server provides:

- A **Solid Pod** — store and manage RDF and binary resources with full LDP protocol support
- **ActivityPub federation** — follow and be followed by accounts on Mastodon, Pixelfed, and other fediverse servers
- A **WebID profile** — a standards-based decentralized identity
- **OIDC provider** — authenticate with Solid apps using your own server as the identity provider
- A **web UI** — dashboard, profile editor, activity feed, file browser, and access control editor
- **Security hardening** — rate limiting, request size limits, storage quotas, SSRF protection, app write restrictions, and HTTP Signature verification

Uses [s20e](https://github.com/chapeaux/s20e) as the RDF/SPARQL engine (Oxigraph compiled to WASM). Everything else — authentication, federation, LDP, UI — is vanilla JavaScript using only Web APIs.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/daryltd/paa.pub)

## Quick start

There are three ways to deploy:

1. **Deploy button** (above) — click, connect your GitHub fork, and configure in the Cloudflare dashboard
2. **GitHub Actions** — fork the repo and set up automated deploys on push
3. **Manual** — clone, configure `wrangler.toml`, and deploy with the Wrangler CLI

All three require creating KV namespaces and an R2 bucket first (step 2 below).

### Option A: Deploy button

Click the deploy button above. Cloudflare will walk you through:

1. Forking the repo to your GitHub account
2. Connecting it to your Cloudflare account
3. Creating a Worker

After deployment, you still need to create the storage resources (step 2 below), update `wrangler.toml` with the IDs, set secrets (step 3), and re-deploy.

### Option B: GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

1. Fork this repo
2. Create the Cloudflare resources (step 2 below) and update `wrangler.toml` with your KV/R2 IDs
3. In your fork's **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**, add:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — create one at [dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) with the **Edit Cloudflare Workers** template
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` — found on the Workers overview page
4. Set app secrets with `wrangler secret put PAA_PASSWORD` and `wrangler secret put PAA_DOMAIN`
5. Push to `main` — the workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` deploys automatically

### Option C: Manual deploy

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **Wrangler CLI** (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- A **Cloudflare account** (free tier works)

#### 1. Clone and install

```sh
git clone <repo-url> paa.pub
cd paa.pub
npm install
```

The s20e triplestore (Oxigraph WASM kernel, orchestrator, and Cloudflare adapter) is installed automatically from [JSR](https://jsr.io/@s20e) as an npm dependency.

### 2. Create Cloudflare resources

Log in to Wrangler and create the required storage:

```sh
wrangler login
wrangler kv namespace create TRIPLESTORE
wrangler kv namespace create APPDATA
wrangler r2 bucket create my-solid-blobs
```

Each `kv namespace create` command prints an ID. Update `wrangler.toml` with your values:

```toml
name = "my-solid-server"
main = "src/index.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[vars]
PAA_USERNAME = "alice"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "TRIPLESTORE"
id = "<your-triplestore-namespace-id>"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "APPDATA"
id = "<your-appdata-namespace-id>"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "BLOBS"
bucket_name = "my-solid-blobs"

[[rules]]
type = "Text"
globs = ["**/*.html", "**/*.css", "**/client/*.js"]
fallthrough = true
```

### 3. Set secrets

```sh
wrangler secret put PAA_PASSWORD    # choose a strong login password
wrangler secret put PAA_DOMAIN      # your domain, e.g. solid.example.com
```

### 4. Set up a custom domain (recommended)

In the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare (if not already)
2. Go to **Workers & Pages** → your worker → **Settings** → **Domains & Routes**
3. Add a custom domain (e.g. `solid.example.com`)

Without a custom domain, your server will be available at `<worker-name>.<subdomain>.workers.dev`, which works but results in a long WebID URL.

### 5. Deploy

```sh
npm run deploy
```

On the first request, the server automatically bootstraps: creates your user account, generates an RSA keypair for ActivityPub federation, initializes root containers, writes a WebID profile document, and sets default access policies.

Visit `https://your-domain.com/login` to sign in with your password.

## Local development

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts a local server at `http://localhost:8787` with Wrangler's simulated KV and R2 storage.

Create a `.dev.vars` file for local secrets (git-ignored):

```
PAA_PASSWORD=localdevpassword
```

The domain auto-detects as `localhost:8787` in development. Your WebID will be `http://localhost:8787/<username>/profile/card#me`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Where | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PAA_USERNAME` | `wrangler.toml` `[vars]` | `admin` | Your username (appears in URLs) |
| `PAA_PASSWORD` | Secret | *(required)* | Login password |
| `PAA_DOMAIN` | Secret or `[vars]` | auto-detected | Public domain (e.g. `solid.example.com`) |
| `PAA_STORAGE_LIMIT` | `[vars]` or secret | `1GB` | Maximum storage usage (e.g. `500MB`, `2GB`) |
| `PAA_FEED_LIMIT` | `[vars]` | `50` | Maximum activities shown in the feed |

**Choosing a username**: Your username appears in every URL on your server (`/alice/profile/card`, `/alice/public/`, etc.) and in your WebID. Pick something short. It cannot be changed after bootstrap without re-creating all data.

## What you get

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

Overview of your server: WebID, follower/following/post counts, pending follow request notifications, storage breakdown by resource type, and passkey management.

### Profile editor (`/profile`)

Edit your WebID profile fields (name, bio, avatar, homepage, etc.) and manage custom RDF triples. Reset your public profile page template if you've customized it.

### Activity feed (`/activity`)

- **Compose** posts with audience selection (public, unlisted, followers-only, private)
- **Follow** fediverse accounts by handle (`user@mastodon.social`) or actor URL
- **Follow requests** — incoming follows require manual approval; accept or reject each request from the activity page
- **Feed** shows inbox and outbox activities merged chronologically, limited to `PAA_FEED_LIMIT` entries
- **Remote feeds** — click any follower or followed account to view their recent public posts

### Remote profile feed (`/activity/remote?actor=<uri>`)

View a remote actor's public outbox, limited to the configured feed limit. Accessible by clicking any follower or following link on the activity page.

### File storage (`/storage/`)

Browse your Solid pod. Upload files, create containers, create and edit text/RDF resources. Each resource links to its access policy editor. Uploads and creates are subject to the global storage quota (`PAA_STORAGE_LIMIT`) and per-container quotas.

### Access policy editor (`/acp/`)

Control who can read your resources:

- **Inherit from parent** — use the same policy as the parent container (default for new resources)
- **Public** — anyone can read
- **Public (unlisted)** — readable with direct link, not listed in container indexes
- **Friends** — only WebIDs in your friends list
- **Private** — only you
- **Custom** — specific WebIDs you choose

Container policies propagate to their contents unless overridden. You can disable inheritance per container to require each child resource to have its own policy.

**Per-container storage quotas**: For containers, the ACP editor includes a storage quota card where you can set a byte limit (e.g. `500MB`). Quotas are hierarchical — a write must satisfy every ancestor container's quota.

### App permissions (`/app-permissions`)

Manage which OIDC-authenticated Solid apps can write to your pod. When you authorize an app via the OIDC consent flow, you select which containers it may write to. The app permissions page lets you review, update, or revoke access for each app.

Session-authenticated access (via the web UI) always has unrestricted write access.

### Public profile page (`/{username}/`)

Your root container serves a Mustache-rendered landing page showing your profile data. The template is editable through the Storage UI and resettable from the Profile editor.

### Solid protocol

Your pod is accessible at `/{username}/` via standard LDP methods:

```sh
# Read a resource
curl -H "Accept: text/turtle" https://solid.example.com/alice/profile/card

# Create a resource
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: text/turtle" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '<#this> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Alice" .' \
  https://solid.example.com/alice/public/hello.ttl

# Create a container
curl -X POST \
  -H "Slug: notes" \
  -H 'Link: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#BasicContainer>; rel="type"' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  https://solid.example.com/alice/public/

# SPARQL Update
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/sparql-update" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d 'INSERT DATA { <#this> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/nick> "ally" . }' \
  https://solid.example.com/alice/public/hello.ttl

# Upload a binary file
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: image/png" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  --data-binary @photo.png \
  https://solid.example.com/alice/public/photo.png
```

### ActivityPub federation

```sh
# WebFinger discovery
curl https://solid.example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:alice@solid.example.com

# Actor document
curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" https://solid.example.com/alice/profile/card

# Collections
curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" https://solid.example.com/alice/outbox
curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" https://solid.example.com/alice/followers
```

Remote servers can follow your account by sending a `Follow` activity to `/{username}/inbox`. Follow requests are held pending until you accept or reject them from the activity page.

### OIDC provider

Your server acts as an OpenID Connect provider. Solid apps can authenticate against it:

```
Discovery:  https://solid.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
Authorize:  https://solid.example.com/authorize
Token:      https://solid.example.com/token
UserInfo:   https://solid.example.com/userinfo
JWKS:       https://solid.example.com/jwks
```

When authorizing an app, you choose which pod containers it may write to. Apps that were previously authorized without container selection will be re-prompted.

## Security

The server includes defense-in-depth hardening for public-facing deployment:

| Layer | Protection |
|---|---|
| **Rate limiting** | KV-backed sliding window limits on login (10/15min), token (30/min), inbox (60/min), registration (10/hr), and LDP writes (60/min). Returns 429 with `Retry-After`. |
| **Request size limits** | Content-Length checked before body read: 1 MB for JSON, 5 MB for RDF, 100 MB for binary uploads. Returns 413. |
| **Storage quotas** | Global limit via `PAA_STORAGE_LIMIT` (default 1 GB). Per-container quotas configurable in the ACP editor. Returns 507. |
| **SSRF protection** | All outbound `fetch()` calls validate URLs — blocks private IPs, localhost, and non-HTTP(S) schemes. |
| **HTTP Signature verification** | Incoming ActivityPub activities require a valid HTTP Signature. Actors without a public key are rejected (401). Date header must be within 5 minutes to prevent replay. |
| **Inbox validation** | Activities missing an `id` field are rejected. Actor URIs are SSRF-validated before fetching. |
| **Security headers** | HTML responses include `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. |
| **Error sanitization** | Internal errors return `Internal Server Error` with no stack traces or error messages exposed. |
| **App write restrictions** | OIDC-authenticated apps can only write to containers the owner explicitly approved during the consent flow. Session-authenticated owner has unrestricted access. |

The permissive CORS policy (reflected Origin + credentials) is required by the Solid protocol specification and is not restricted.

## Cloudflare resource usage

This runs on the free tier for low-traffic personal use:

| Resource | Free tier limit | Typical usage |
|---|---|---|
| Workers requests | 100,000/day | Each page view or API call = 1 request |
| KV reads | 100,000/day | ~2-5 reads per LDP request |
| KV writes | 1,000/day | Writes when creating/editing resources |
| R2 storage | 10 GB | Binary files (images, documents, etc.) |
| R2 operations | 1M Class A, 10M Class B/month | Blob reads and writes |

For heavier usage, the Workers Paid plan ($5/month) removes these limits.

## Design decisions

- **Zero external services** — everything runs within one Cloudflare Worker using KV and R2. No databases, no queues, no external APIs required.
- **s20e WASM kernel** handles SPARQL queries and WAC enforcement. The app writes to KV directly for performance, falling back to the orchestrator for operations that need SPARQL.
- **Direct KV** for ActivityPub data — simple JSON read/write with index arrays. No need for SPARQL here.
- **Web Crypto API** for all cryptography — PBKDF2 password hashing, RSA HTTP Signatures, WebAuthn signature verification.
- **No build tools** beyond Wrangler's built-in esbuild bundling. No frameworks, no transpilers.
- **Server-rendered HTML** with Mustache templates. No client-side JavaScript framework.
- **Single-user** design — one username, one pod, one ActivityPub actor. KV eventual consistency is acceptable since write contention is rare.
- **Manual follow approval** — incoming Follow requests are stored as pending until the owner accepts or rejects them. Accept/Reject activities are delivered back to the requesting actor.
- **App sandboxing** — OIDC-authenticated apps are restricted to writing only within containers the owner approved during the consent flow, preventing unauthorized writes.

## Troubleshooting

**"PAA_PASSWORD environment variable must be set"** — You haven't set the password secret. Run `wrangler secret put PAA_PASSWORD`.

**WebID or actor URLs show `localhost:8787`** — Set `PAA_DOMAIN` to your production domain: `wrangler secret put PAA_DOMAIN`.

**Domain mismatch after changing domains** — The server re-bootstraps when it detects a domain change, updating all IRIs. If you see issues, you may need to clear KV data and let it re-bootstrap fresh.

**Federation not working** — Your domain must be publicly accessible over HTTPS. Cloudflare Workers handle HTTPS automatically with custom domains. Check that WebFinger responds correctly: `curl https://yourdomain/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:youruser@yourdomain`.

**429 Too Many Requests** — Rate limiting is active. Wait for the `Retry-After` period (shown in the response header) before retrying.

**507 Insufficient Storage** — Storage quota exceeded. Either increase `PAA_STORAGE_LIMIT` or delete unused resources. For container quotas, adjust the limit in the ACP editor.

**403 on OIDC app writes** — The app doesn't have permission to write to the target container. Update its allowed containers at `/app-permissions` or re-authorize the app.
